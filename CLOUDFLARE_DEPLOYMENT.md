# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## ❌ The Problem: 404 Errors on Cloudflare

Your app was getting 404 errors because:
1. **Static Export Limitation**: Your Next.js config had `output: 'export'` which creates a static site
2. **API Routes Don't Work**: Static export doesn't support Next.js API routes (`/api/parse-conversation` and `/api/generate-pdf`)
3. **404 Errors**: When your frontend tries to call these API endpoints, they return 404 because they don't exist in the static build

## ✅ Solution 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

**I've already fixed your config for Vercel deployment:**

### Deploy to Vercel:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
4. Deploy with default settings

**Why Vercel?**
- ✅ Native Next.js support with API routes
- ✅ Puppeteer works out of the box
- ✅ No configuration needed
- ✅ Better performance for Next.js apps

## 🔧 Solution 2: Cloudflare Pages with Functions

If you want to stick with Cloudflare, I've created Cloudflare Functions for you:

### Deploy to Cloudflare:
1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Update build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `.next`
   - **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty)
3. The functions are already in the `functions/` directory

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If website still doesn't show:

1. **Check the URL**: Your site should be at `https://your-project-name.pages.dev`
2. **Check build logs**: Look for any errors in the deployment logs
3. **Clear browser cache**: Try opening in incognito mode
4. **Check custom domain**: If you set one, make sure DNS is configured

### Common Issues:
- **404 errors**: Build output directory might be wrong
- **API not working**: Cloudflare Functions might need different setup
- **Static files not loading**: Check if assets are being served correctly

## 📞 Need Help?

If the issue persists:
1. Check the Cloudflare Pages documentation
2. Consider using Vercel for Next.js apps
3. Or use a different hosting platform like Netlify

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your deployment is working when:
- ✅ Website loads at the provided URL
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ API endpoints respond (even if with mock data)
- ✅ Static assets load correctly
