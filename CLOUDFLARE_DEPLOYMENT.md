# 🚀 Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Your deployment was successful, but the website might not be visible due to configuration issues. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Update Cloudflare Pages Settings
In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to **Builds & deployments**
3. Update the build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run pages:build`
   - **Build output directory**: `.next`
   - **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty)

### 2. Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Retry deployment** on the latest deployment
3. Or trigger a new deployment by pushing a commit

## 🎯 Alternative: Use Vercel (Recommended)

Since your app uses Next.js API routes, Vercel might be a better choice:

### Deploy to Vercel:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js
4. Deploy with default settings

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If website still doesn't show:

1. **Check the URL**: Your site should be at `https://your-project-name.pages.dev`
2. **Check build logs**: Look for any errors in the deployment logs
3. **Clear browser cache**: Try opening in incognito mode
4. **Check custom domain**: If you set one, make sure DNS is configured

### Common Issues:
- **404 errors**: Build output directory might be wrong
- **API not working**: Cloudflare Functions might need different setup
- **Static files not loading**: Check if assets are being served correctly

## 📞 Need Help?

If the issue persists:
1. Check the Cloudflare Pages documentation
2. Consider using Vercel for Next.js apps
3. Or use a different hosting platform like Netlify

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your deployment is working when:
- ✅ Website loads at the provided URL
- ✅ No 404 errors
- ✅ API endpoints respond (even if with mock data)
- ✅ Static assets load correctly
